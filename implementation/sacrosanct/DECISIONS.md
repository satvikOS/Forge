# Sacrosanct execution — decision record

Each entry: the question, the constraints, what the evidence says, what was chosen, what was
rejected and why, whether it is reversible, and the measurement that would settle it.

## D-001 — Desktop UI stack: **Dear ImGui** — **RESOLVED by the user, 2026-08-28**

**Decision.** Dear ImGui, **not** Qt — but it must deliver the robustness, UI/UX system design,
layout, framework, structure, shell, browser/tree ("branches"), and overlays of **Siemens NX,
CATIA, and Blender**, in pure C++. A CAD workstation, not a debug overlay.

**Standing of this decision against Sacrosanct.** §19.2 names Qt 6 Widgets + KDDockWidgets. The
user has overridden that specific *technology* selection while keeping every *capability* §19.2
requires. This is the permitted direction of change: Sacrosanct says an implementation "may improve
these requirements but may not silently weaken them." Nothing is weakened here — the capability
list below is carried over verbatim and is now owed on ImGui. §19.2's technology row is superseded;
its contract rows are not.

**Why this is coherent rather than a shortcut.** The repository's own
`docs/FORGE_CPP_MIGRATION.md` §1.2 already argued this position in detail on 2026-07-16 — headed
"NOT Qt", with four recorded grounds. Two of them survive scrutiny independently of taste:

1. **Licensing.** Qt LGPLv3 permits proprietary use only via dynamic linking and compels a
   *prominent in-user-interface notice*. Forge is free-but-proprietary and wants a statically
   linkable binary. Sacrosanct Law 16 binds the *dependency stack* to be open source and
   source-buildable — it does **not** make Forge itself open source, so it never dissolved this
   obligation. KDDockWidgets (GPL/commercial) raised the same question again. **ImGui is MIT.**
   Both obligations disappear rather than being accepted.
2. **Latency.** ImGui emits draw lists into the *same* command buffer as the CAD scene — no second
   context, no per-frame FBO copy, and overlays can blend freely over geometry (translucent HUDs,
   modal sketch dimming, radial menus over the part).

The capability argument that favoured Qt — accessibility trees, rich-text, printing, deep i18n —
is real and is **not** waived. It becomes owed work on the ImGui path, recorded below.

**What is now owed (carried from §19.2 and §19.2.1, unchanged):**
- One versioned C++ command registry. Every command has a stable ID, label, category, shortcut,
  required selection signature, enabled predicate, parameter schema, preview policy, side-effect
  class, undo contract, and equivalent feature-IR operation. Menus, toolbars, command search,
  context and radial menus, shortcuts, macros, **and Archie tool calls** all route through it. The
  UI is never wired directly to a widget callback.
- A typed selection service with separate preselection / selection / focus / committed states,
  resolving to stable topology references — never a raw face index.
- Saveable dockable workspaces with deterministic default layouts and multi-monitor recovery. This
  is the one thing KDDockWidgets would have supplied for free; on ImGui it must be an explicit
  dock/layout serialization model, and it is now a first-class deliverable rather than a library
  call.
- Workspace profiles: Part, Sketch, Assembly, Surface, Manufacturing, Drawing, Simulation, Archie.
- Input-map profiles — Forge-native, NX-like, CATIA-like, Blender-like — over the *same* command IDs.
- A feature-tree UI that virtualizes enormous graphs (§19.4).
- **Accessibility, printing, and i18n remain owed.** They were Qt's strongest argument. Choosing
  ImGui converts them from free wins into scheduled work; it does not delete them. Tracked as
  follow-on, not silently dropped.

**Consequence for the renderer.** §19.2 selects Diligent Engine with a Metal backend, while the
existing `forge-desktop/` probes vendor Vulkan GLSL shaders. That is a separate, still-open
question — this decision settles the *UI framework*, not the *render backend*. Recorded as D-006.

**Reversible?** Cheaply today — `forge-desktop/` is six headless probe programs, not an app, so
almost nothing is sunk. Expensive once the 445-function kernel surface has a UI on top of it.

## D-002 — Sacrosanct 3.1 placed at `docs/sacrosanct/`, not `output/pdf/` — **DECIDED**

The execution brief suggested `output/pdf/Archie_Sacrosanct_v3.1.pdf` "or an equivalent versioned
PDF." `output/` reads as build output and is a deletion target under the storage governor; a
normative constitution must never sit in a directory a garbage collector may treat as disposable.
Placed at `docs/sacrosanct/` with a text extraction and recorded SHA-256 for both. Reversible.

## D-003 — `sacrosanct.md` left untouched — **DECIDED**

The working tree's `sacrosanct.md` shows −1136/+181 against HEAD. That is the uncommitted
2026-07-26 **v2 rewrite**, not a truncation accident. It was preserved byte-for-byte and the
three-generation lineage documented in `docs/sacrosanct/README.md`. Overwriting it with 3.1 would
have destroyed authored work that was never committed anywhere.

---

## D-004 — `kernel-tests.yml` `kernel` job retained despite being Node — **DECIDED**

The macOS OCCT job builds `forge-kernel.node` and runs the smoke suites through Node. It is
JavaScript, and Sacrosanct §3.2 targets its removal. It was **kept** because it is the only coverage
the OCCT-linked kernel has, and §3.2 permits removal only after a mapped C++ owner and C++ test
exist. Deleting it now would be removal-by-extension ahead of its replacement — the specific error
the section forbids. Marked TRANSITIONAL in the workflow and tracked as a deletion target.

The `guards` job and the `Bridge smoke` step were removed, because both are Electron/React app
concerns with no C++ successor to wait for: `bridge_smoke.js` literally launches Electron and
asserts the `window.forge` preload bridge round-trips.

---

## D-005 — Parallel writers must use worktrees — **DECIDED (learned the hard way)**

Five of eight baseline auditors reported HEAD moving underneath them mid-audit. The cause was this
session committing into the shared checkout while read-only agents were reading it. No finding was
invalidated (the SHA held during the census and results were re-verified), but the rule is now
binding: **parallel writers get their own worktree; audits pin a SHA and report against it, never
against `HEAD`;** and any manifest derived from a census is re-validated against the SHA actually
checked out when it executes.

---

## D-006 — Render backend: Diligent/Metal vs the existing Vulkan probes — **OPEN**

D-001 settled the UI framework (ImGui). It did not settle the renderer. Sacrosanct §19.2 selects
**Diligent Engine with a Metal backend** on Apple Silicon and requires ONE authoritative
interactive renderer. `forge-desktop/` currently vendors **4 Vulkan GLSL shaders**, and the
migration doc's latency argument assumed a Vulkan command buffer.

On macOS, Vulkan is only available through MoltenVK translation, so "Vulkan on M4 Max" is Metal
with a layer in front. §19.2's Metal-first selection is therefore the better-supported path and the
ImGui co-composite argument holds equally well on Metal. Leaning Diligent/Metal, but it needs a
measured comparison rather than a document quote, and no UI work depends on it yet.
